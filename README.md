# Enterprise Library 6.0

This repository contains a copy of the "Enterprise Library 6.0", which was released by Microsoft in 2013. It contains some very useful design patterns and applications for the development of complex applications.

# Summary (from Microsoft)

The Microsoft Enterprise Library is a collection of reusable software components (application blocks) designed to assist software developers with common enterprise development cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, validation, data access, exception handling, and many others). Application blocks are a type of guidance; they are provided as source code, test cases, and documentation that can be used "as is," extended, or modified by developers to use on complex, enterprise-level line-of-business development projects.
